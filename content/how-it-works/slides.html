    How do you send EUR to your friend using USD on the Stellar network?<br />
    Letâ€™s start by explaining what exactly is the Stellar network and how it works.

  <p>
    The Internet is made up of a network servers containing our data, <br />
    websites and applications.
  </p>

    Like the Internet, Stellar is a network of decentralized servers <br />
    in many locations that power a distributed ledger.

    This ledger records every transaction in the system for people and companies alike.<br />
    A complete copy of the global ledger exists on each Stellar server.

    Any entity can run a server. The network becomes more robust with more servers.

  <p>
    The servers communicate with each other to verify transactions and sync the ledger every 2-5 seconds. This mechanism is known as consensus.
  </p>

    The ledger records your money as credit which is issued by gateways. Gateways act as a bridge between a given currency and the Stellar network. <br />
    Banks and payment processors are good examples of real world gateways.

    Credit is issued to your online account which acts like a virtual wallet in exchange for your deposit. They have to be trusted to hold your money and honor your withdrawals.
  </p>

    Issued credit can be sent and received between people on the network. Stellar has a distributed exchange, so you can send EUR credits to your friend using your USD credit balance. The network will automatically convert it at the lowest rate for you.

    Your friend will receive EUR credit, <br />
    which she can withdraw using a gateway supporting EUR.
